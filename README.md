## TODO

* How to setup Postgres?
* Django Rest Framework.
* Various attributes of model properties.
* How associations are done. Go deeper into associated objects/creation.
  * For `ForeignKey`, what are my options? The inverse name appears to be `toy_set`, but I query like `Cat.objects.filter(toy__name="mousey")`?
* Chaining queries onto QuerySet.
* Templates
  * Reduce repetition of loading templates and everything.
* How are form errors handled?
* Generic views: how are new or create views handled. That wasn't
  explained.
* Must learn about validators!
  * Clean vs validate vs check. They're all Field methods?
  * How to add custom DB constraints?
* How are files/images handled?
* I feel like I'm still a little hazy on 'through' relations.
* And I don't really know how model validation is done.
* And I don't know how to do constraints.
* Nested queries?
