## TODO

* How to setup Postgres?
* Django Rest Framework.
* Various attributes of model properties.
* How associations are done. Go deeper into associated objects/creation.
  * For `ForeignKey`, what are my options? The inverse name appears to be `toy_set`, but I query like `Cat.objects.filter(toy__name="mousey")`?
* Chaining queries onto QuerySet.
