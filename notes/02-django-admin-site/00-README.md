## TODO

* I will not cover super-deep customization of the Django admin.
* To do so, I would have to learn more about Django forms and formsets.
  This is out of my immediate scope.
* If I wanted to do deep customization, I could also look into
  overriding the Django admin templates.
  * This is documented here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/admin/#overriding-admin-templates

**TODO**

* I haven't read about custom actions yet: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/admin/actions/
  * After I read this, I want to put Django admin to bed.
