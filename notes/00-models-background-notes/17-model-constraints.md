## Constraints

Constraints are added on the model class's `Meta`. Constraints are
enforced at DB level and will not raise any validation errors. The
exception is `UniqueConstraint`.

```python
class Cat(models.Model):
    # Enforce that a cat always has age > 0.
    #
    # Note that name is always required (isn't autogenerated)
    constraints = [
        models.CheckConstraint(
            check=models.Q(age__gt=0), name="cat_age_gt_zero"
        )
    ]
```

* You can also have `UniqueConstraint(fields=[...])`.
